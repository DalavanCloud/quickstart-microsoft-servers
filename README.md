## Microsoft Servers on AWS

The AWS Cloud provides a suite of infrastructure services that help you deploy Microsoft workloads for your test or production use on AWS. This Quick Start deploys five popular business productivity servers from Microsoft — SharePoint Server, Lync Server, Exchange Server, SQL Server, and Web Application Proxy with AD FS — with a single click, in a highly available Multi-AZ architecture on AWS.

By deploying this Quick Start, you can take advantage of the email, collaboration, communications, and directory features provided by the Microsoft servers along with the flexibility and security of AWS. The advantages of running Microsoft servers on AWS include add-on compatibility, scalability, agility, cost, optimization, reliability, and high availability.

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
